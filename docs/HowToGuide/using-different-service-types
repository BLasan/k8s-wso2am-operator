### Using Different Service Types

In this WSO2AM K8S Operator, there are different kinds of service types a user can specify to access the apimanager via them.

- The default service type is the **LoadBalancer** type which is given in the
  [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/wso2-incubator/wso2am-k8s-operator/blob/master/README.md)

- Then the next type is the **NodePort** service type. Both Minikube and GCP supports this service type. 
  This workflow is given under [scenario-2](https://github.com/wso2-incubator/wso2am-k8s-operator/tree/master/scenarios/scenario-2)

- The last service type is the **ClusterIP**, there the servies are being exposed to outside world through Ingresses. 
  The workflow for using these Ingresses are given under [scenario-8](https://github.com/wso2-incubator/wso2am-k8s-operator/tree/master/scenarios/scenario-8)
